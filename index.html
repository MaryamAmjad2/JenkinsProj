    <h1>A Day At Space Needle</h1>
    <p>A day at Space Needle in Washington was definitely worth the time!<br>
    I went up on the observation deck of the tower and the view was absolutely amazing!
    And the food was great, too!<br>If you are ever in Seattle, be sure to visit the Space Needle! You won't regret it!</p>
